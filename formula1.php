                        <p>Mercedes’ modern F1 revival started with the creation of a works squad for 2010 - the platform for a meteoric rise up the Grand Prix order. 
                        The team generated <em>huge</em> excitement from the off with the sensational return of Michael Schumacher, but headlines soon followed on track:  
                        three podiums in their debut season, all via Nico Rosberg - who then claimed a breakthrough pole/victory double at China in 2012.</p>
                        <p>The following season he was paired with Lewis Hamilton, the duo going on to stage some epic title battles as the Silver Arrows swept 
                        all before them to become one of the most dominant forces of the modern F1 era. And with Hamilton now partnered by the up-and-coming George 
                        Russell, Mercedes remain <em>very much</em> <strong>the team that everyone wants to beat...</strong></p>
                        <p>Mercedes-Benz, a brand of the Mercedes-Benz Group, has been involved in Formula One as both team owner and engine manufacturer for 
                        various periods since 1954. The Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team, which is based in Brackley, England, and possesses a German licence, as of 2022 majority 
                        owned by the Mercedes-Benz Group with Toto Wolff having a <em>significant</em> shareholding. </p>
                        <p>Mercedes-branded teams are often referred to by the nickname, the "Silver Arrows". An announcement was made in December 2020 that Ineos planned to 
                        take a one third equal ownership stake alongside the Mercedes-Benz Group and Wolff; this came into effect on 25 January 2022.</p>
                        <p>Since a major rule shake-up in 2014, which required the use of turbochargers and hybrid electric engines, <strong> Mercedes has become one of the most 
                        successful teams in Formula One history, winning seven consecutive Drivers' titles from 2014 to 2020 and eight consecutive Constructors' 
                        titles from 2014 to 2021.</strong> It has set records for most wins in a season (19 in 2016), and for most consecutive constructors' titles. <strong>The 
                        manufacturer has also collected more than 200 wins as an engine supplier and is ranked second in Formula One history. Ten Constructors' and thirteen 
                        Drivers' Championships have been won with Mercedes-Benz engines.</strong></p>

                    <h3>2010-2014</h3>
                        <p>The team was rebranded as Mercedes GP Petronas Formula One Team, and Mercedes would now compete in the constructors' championship for the first time. 
                        Ross Brawn continued his duties as team principal and the team retained its base and workforce in Brackley, close to the Mercedes-Benz Formula One 
                        engine plant (formerly Ilmor Engineering) in Brixworth.</p>
                        <p>The team has a <em>complex</em> history: Its entry can be traced back to Tyrrell Racing, who competed as a constructor from 1970 until 1998, until being 
                        bought by British American Tobacco at the end of 1997 so its entry could be transferred to the then new constructor British American Racing (BAR) 
                        in 1999. BAR, who had formed a partnership with Honda, eventually became Honda Racing F1 Team in 2006 when British American Tobacco withdrew from the sport. </p>
                        <p>It again changed hands in 2008, when Honda withdrew, and was purchased by the team's management, naming it Brawn GP after team principal Ross Brawn. 
                        Brawn used engines from Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines, and despite running on a low budget, Jenson Button won six of the first seven races 
                        and ultimately the 2009 Drivers' Championship, while Brawn won the Constructors' Championship. <strong>It was the first time in the sport's sixty-year history
                        that a team won both titles in its maiden season.</strong></p>
                        <p>Nico Rosberg scored Mercedes's first podium finish as a works team since 1955 at the 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix Team Mercedes GP hired German drivers Nico Rosberg, 
                        and seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, who returned to Formula One after a three-year absence, and Nick Heidfeld as the test and reserve driver. 
                        Of Brawn's 2009 drivers, Jenson Button signed for McLaren, whilst Rubens Barrichello moved to Rosberg's former seat with Williams team for 2010.</p>
                        <p>For 2012, the team removed the GP from their name and added the name of AMG, the high performance brand of Daimler AG, to their title. The team would  
                        officially get the designation Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team. At the start of the season Mercedes was the subject of protest over the use of a "radical" 
                        rear wing concept on the Mercedes F1 W03 racing car, which was not settled until the third race in China when <strong>the stewards unanimously rejected the protest.</strong></p>
                        <p>On 28 September 2012, it was announced that McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton would join the Mercedes team from the 2013 season onwards, having signed a three-year deal to partner 
                        Nico Rosberg in the team. In January 2013, Toto Wolff became an executive director of the Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team, with his business partner Rene Berger
                        becoming non-executive director. In addition to joining the team as managing partner, he also acquired 30% of Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix Ltd, with a further 10% held by 
                        Niki Lauda, chairman of the board, and 60% by the parent company. Wolff took over the co-ordination of all Mercedes-Benz motorsport 
                        activities, a responsibility previously held by Norbert Haug.</p>
                        <p>Mercedes then went on to take third place in the Canadian Grand Prix courtesy of Hamilton, followed by another win for Rosberg at the British Grand Prix after the 
                        team took 1–2 in qualifying. The team then celebrated their third win of the season after Hamilton took his first victory for the team at the Hungarian Grand Prix, 
                        resulting in second place ahead of Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship.</p>

                    <h3>2014-2021</h3>

                    <p>Both drivers were retained for 2014. Rosberg won the first race of the season in Australia, then in Malaysia, <strong>Hamilton completed a grand slam </strong>– leading every 
                    lap from pole position, with the fastest race lap – while Rosberg completed a 1–2 finish for the team; it ended Hamilton's nine race streak without a podium finish, 
                    and was the first 1–2 finish by Mercedes as a works team since the 1955 Italian Grand Prix.</p>
                    <p>At the Russian Grand Prix the team won their first Constructors' Championship as a works team. Hamilton won the last race of the season, held in Abu Dhabi. 
                    He finished the season 67 points ahead of Rosberg, clinching the World Drivers' Championship. The team finished the 2014 season 296 points 
                    <em>ahead of their closest rival </em>Red Bull Racing in the World Constructors' Championship standings. With 18 pole positions, 
                    16 wins and 11 1–2s out of 19 races, Mercedes dominated this first year of the V6 turbo era. For their 16 race victories, 
                    the average winning margin to the nearest non-Mercedes competitor was 23.2 seconds.</p>
                    <p>At the 2015 Russian Grand Prix the team won their second Constructors' Championship as a works team and Hamilton won his second consecutive Drivers'  
                    Championship at the 2015 United States Grand Prix, finishing 59 points ahead of Rosberg. Mercedes continued their domination in this second year of the V6 
                    turbo era, improving on their impressive numbers from 2014 with 18 pole positions, 16 wins and 12 1–2s in 19 races. Of their 16 race victories, the average 
                    winning margin to the nearest non-Mercedes competitor was 19.7 seconds, down from 23.2 seconds in 2014.</p>
                    <p>In the 2016 season, Mercedes won the Constructors' Championship for the third consecutive season, winning 19 of the 21 races held, while securing 20 poles
                    (the highest percentage ever in a single season of F1 at 95.2%) and 8 1–2s. The average winning gap to the nearest non-Mercedes driver dropped
                    to 14.6 seconds. Rosberg won his only Drivers' Championship, finishing 5 points ahead of Hamilton, before announcing his retirement shortly after 
                    winning the title.</p>
                    <p>On 16 January 2017, Valtteri Bottas was announced as Rosberg's replacement for the 2017 season and British GP3 driver George Russell was incorporated into the junior team. 
                    On 22 October 2017, Mercedes won the Constructors' Championship for the fourth consecutive time. One week later, Lewis Hamilton became the first British driver to win four world championships. 
                    Mercedes finished the 2017 season with 12 wins out of 20 races, 15 poles, 4 1–2s and an average winning margin to the nearest non-Mercedes driver of 13.1 seconds.</p>
                    <p>For the 2018 season the team retained both Hamilton and Bottas. In the 2018 season, Mercedes won 11 races (all for Hamilton) out of 21 races, took 10 fastest laps 
                    (three for Hamilton and seven for Bottas), 13 pole positions (eleven for Hamilton and two for Bottas), and four 1–2 finishes. This made <strong>Mercedes only the second team in the history 
                    in F1 to achieve the feat of winning 5 drivers' and constructors' titles in a row</strong>, after Ferrari did so between 2000 and 2004.</p>
                    <p>For the 2019 season, the team again retained both Hamilton and Bottas. The team continued the strong performance through the first half of the season. By the summer break, 
                    Mercedes had won 10 out of 12 races with Hamilton taking 8 victories to Bottas's 2, securing 1–2 finishes at the first 5 races of the season. The team would go on to take both the 
                    drivers and constructors titles for the sixth consecutive year.</p>
                    <p>The team debuted their "Dual-Axis-Steering" system during pre-season testing for the 2020 season. This allows the driver to change the toe of the front wheels by pushing or 
                    pulling on the steering wheel. This allows the driver to optimise the car for better tyre warming on the straights with zero toe, or better mechanical grip in the corners with positive toe. 
                    The system was allowed for the 2020 season, but <strong>has been made illegal</strong> for 2021.</p>
                    <p>The team would go on to win both the drivers and constructors championships. Before the penultimate round of the season, the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix, Hamilton was forced to sit the race out 
                    following a positive coronavirus test, with Williams driver and Mercedes junior George Russell replacing him.</p>
                    <p>For 2021, the team retained the same driver line-up for a fifth straight season. The team failed to win the drivers' championship for the first time in the V6 turbo-hybrid era, with Hamilton 
                    being overtaken by title rival Max Verstappen on the last lap of the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, after <strong>a controversial safety car restart</strong>. Hamilton had comfortably led the race and been 
                    on course for his eighth title before a late safety car. </p>
                    <p>The actions of FIA race director Michael Masi surrounding the controversial procedures used during the late safety car caused Mercedes to file an intention to appeal the results of that race, though this was 
                    later withdrawn. Hamilton finished second in the championship, eight points behind champion Verstappen, with Bottas third in the standings in his final season with the team. <strong>The team 
                    took the constructors' title for a record-extending eighth consecutive season.</strong></p>

                <p>Torger Christian "Toto" Wolff (born 12 January 1972) is an Austrian billionaire motorsport executive, investor, and former racing driver.
                 He holds a 33% stake in the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team and is Team Principal and CEO of the team.</p>

                <p>Wolff began his motorsport career in the Austrian Formula Ford Championship and the German Formula Ford Series. He won his category in the 1994 24 Hours Nürburgring and later competed in the FIA GT Championship and Italian GT Championship. As an investor, Wolff founded Marchfifteen in 1998 and Marchsixteen Investments in 2004, initially focusing on Internet and technology companies. He specializes in strategic investments in medium-sized industrial and listed companies, which have included Williams F1 and German HWA AG.</p>
                
                <p>For 2019, Mercedes continued its success by securing a sixth consecutive double world championship at the Japanese GP, when the team secured the Constructors' title and only one of Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas could still become Drivers' champion. This is an <strong>unprecedented achievement in the history of the sport.</strong> As of 2019, Wolff is <em>the only</em> Team Principal who has won more than five consecutive double world championships.</p>

                <p>In 2020, Mercedes secured a seventh consecutive double world championship. The championship set an all-time record of consecutive constructors' championships, ahead of the six Ferrari achieved from 1999 to 2004. In the same season, Hamilton became the most successful driver in terms of race wins at the 2020 Portuguese GP and secured a seventh world drivers' championship at the Turkish GP to tie the record held by Michael Schumacher.The team followed up the achievement with an eighth consecutive constructors' world championship in 2021, whilst finishing second in the drivers.</p>
                
                <p>Since the introduction of the turbo-hybrid regulations in 2014, Mercedes has won 112 of 182 races under Wolff's leadership. The team has taken 119 of 182 pole positions, 74 front-row lockouts, and 249 from 364 possible podium finishes. Since Wolff joined Mercedes in 2013, the team has achieved a winning percentage of 57%.</p>

                <p>After the 2020 F1 season, Wolff signed a new deal with Mercedes to continue as team principal and CEO for at least another three years. <strong>As of 2021, Wolff's net worth is estimated at CHF 1.25 billion (USD ~1.36 billion).</strong></p>

# wiki-emporium
A web project involving me combining mine and three other people's terribly uncurated wiki web pages into a small little display to demonstrate concepts like CSS for navigation, proper layout principles, HTML forms, JS plugins, mobile deesign, and more.

If you're lucky, you might be able to visit it being hosted on: https://www.csc170.com/rchuong/project3/index.php

You might also be able to check out how the individual topic webpages looked like beforehand:

Notes about mobile responsiveness:
Styles are there, but missing a few elements to work properly
